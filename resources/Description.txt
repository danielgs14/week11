Week 11: Simple Linear Regression

Background:
This is the project folder associated with week 11 of EDA-R. This week focuses on simple linear regression.

Data for this exercise was visually and manually extracted from Figure 7A from:

Huang et al. (2017), Sooty tern (Onychoprion fuscatus) survival, oil spills, shrimp fisheries, and hurricanes. PeerJ 5:e3287; DOI 10.7717/peerj.3287

These data was used to illustrate some issues around linear regression, data might be off a bit on either Y or X.
